# RoomSense

RoomSense is an IoT-based smart room monitoring and alert system developed as part of the IoT Development Individual CA.

## Overview
The system uses a Raspberry Pi to collect environmental and occupancy data via sensors and publishes this data to a cloud-hosted Flask web server using PubNub. Sensor readings are stored in a MySQL database and visualised through a Bootstrap-based web dashboard. The system can also trigger alerts using a physical actuator connected to the Raspberry Pi.
